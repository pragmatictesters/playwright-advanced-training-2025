## 🎓 Why Start with Fundamentals?

### Understanding Before Doing
Learning a tool without understanding the context is like learning to drive without understanding traffic rules. You might get the car moving, but you won't know where to go or how to drive safely.

### Making Informed Decisions
Understanding the test pyramid helps you avoid common mistakes like:
- Writing too many slow E2E tests
- Automating the wrong things
- Choosing the wrong tool for your needs

### Career Development
These fundamentals apply to **any** test automation tool, not just Playwright. Understanding these concepts makes you a better automation engineer, regardless of the tools you use.

### Team Communication
Understanding the "why" helps you:
- Explain automation value to stakeholders
- Collaborate effectively with developers and QA
- Make strategic decisions about test coverage
- Justify tool and approach choices
