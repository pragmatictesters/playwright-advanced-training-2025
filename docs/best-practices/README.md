# Best Practices

Welcome to the Best Practices section! This is where you'll learn how to write production-ready, maintainable Playwright tests.

## 📚 Available Guides

### [01. Coding Conventions and Best Practices](./01-coding-conventions.md)
**Start here before writing your first test!**

Learn the coding standards and naming conventions used throughout this training:
- File naming conventions (test files, page objects, fixtures)
- TypeScript naming conventions (classes, interfaces, variables, constants)
- Code organization best practices
- Playwright-specific best practices (locators, assertions, test independence)
- TypeScript best practices (const vs let, type annotations, avoiding any)
- Comment best practices (JSDoc, inline comments)
- Quick reference cheat sheet

**Why read this first?** Installing best practices from the outset prevents bad habits and makes your code maintainable from day one.
